Botguy Directs Disaster Relief Efforts

Disaster has struck Botguy's home in the form of a massive storm! Lightning has started numerous structure fires and flooding has left citizens of Botopia stranded. High winds and isolated tornadoes have caused damage to structures resulting in widespread power outages and serious natural gas leaks. Your team must work with Botguy and the Mayor of Botopia in the Disaster Relief Zone to ensure that emergency vehicles and personnel are dispatched to fight fires and rescue citizens. Transport the Injured Citizens to the hospital to receive much needed treatment and Uninjured Citizens should be taken to the Disaster Relief Zone. Get your firefighters to the buildings that are on fire and douse those buildings with water. Assist the utility crews by shutting off the natural gas and restore electrical service to the downtown area. Water, Food, and Medical Supplies need to be collected and taken to the Disaster Relief Zone and Medical Complex. Now hurry and save the city!

BigBot Strategy: 
Deliver Large Water Container to the burning skyscraper and rescue the two people on top of the non-burning skyscrapers. Afterwards, pick up the gas valve on the side opposite of the medical buildings, as well as the opponent's water reclamation unit if it is kept in its default position.

SmallBot Strategy:
Push the stacks of red, green, and blue items into the medical building at the end of the longest piece of tape. Bring the fire truck and an additional firefighter to the far medical building. Then, bring the remaining four firefighters in the firefighter pole to the close medical building.

NOTE:
Large Water Container may be referred to as "Big Blue" or "blue cube" in the code.
The long strip of tape that spans almost the entire board may be referred to as "Main Street" in the code.
